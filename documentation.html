		<h1>piCollide.js</h1>

		<h2>Getting Started</h2>

		<p>To use piCollide you will need to set your JavaScript file's type to module in the html file. For example if you
			JavaScript file is called "script.js" then in the HTML file it would say:</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
&lt;script src="/script.js" type="module" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

		<p>Also you will need to add the piCollide.js file to your directory. Start by copying and pasting the code from
			the <a href="/piCollide.js">piCollide.js file</a> into a file you create in your directory called "piCollide.js".
		</p>

		<h2>Setting Up a Scene</h2>

		<p>To setup the physics engine you will first need to create the scene that it will be run in:</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
import { piCollide } from "/piCollide.js";
			
// Setup scene
piCollide.setupScene("#FFFFFF");

// Set gravity and drag
piCollide.gravity = 9.81; // Default is 9.81
			
piCollide.drag = 0.99; // Default is 0.99
</pre>

		<p>The input on the setupScene() function determines the colour of the scene background. For example if it was
			"#FFFFFF" the background would be white adn if it was "#000000" the background colour would be black</p>

		<p>Drag determines how much of the balls energy is lost due to air resistance each frame, when set to 1 no energy is
			lost and when set to 0 all the energy is lost meaning the balls will not move. I reccomend air resistance 0.99 for
			regular gravity based physics simulations and an air resistance of 1 for gravity simulations for a more realistic
			effect.</p>

		<br>

		<p>You can also choose to colour balls based on pressure or velocity to debug your simulation or make it more clear
			as to what each object is doing. These settins are both turned off by default</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
// The more blue a ball is the higher the pressure there is on it
piCollide.colourBasedOnPressure: true

// The more red a ball is the faster it is moving
piCollide.colourBasedOnVelocity: true
</pre>

		<h3>Creating the game loop</h3>

		<p>In order for the physics engine to run it needs to be updated every frame allowing the balls to move and collide.
			You can setup a basic game loop as shown below:</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
// Setup the game loop

function worldUpdate() {

	let delta = piCollide.calculateDelta();

	piCollide.updatePhysics(delta); // Deals with collisions between the balls
	piCollide.updatePositions(delta); // Updates the positions of the balls on the screen

	piCollide.renderScene(); // Draws the objects to the screen

	requestAnimationFrame(worldUpdate);

}

requestAnimationFrame(worldUpdate);
</pre>

		<h2>Spawning in a ball</h2>

		<p>You can easily create and add objects to the scene as shown below:</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
// Spawn in circle

// radius is the radius of the ball
// mass is how heavy the ball is, the heavier it is the faster it falls
// colour is the colour of the ball	
// bounce is how much energy is kept after a collision (anything below 1 means energy is lost)
			
let circleObject = piCollide.circleGeometry({
	radius: 10,
	mass: 50,
	colour: piCollide.rgba(255, 0, 0, 1),
	bounce: 0.95
});

circleObject.position.set(100, 100);
circleObject.velocity.set(100, 100);

piCollide.addObject(circleObject);
</pre>

		<p>You can also create empty objects which can be used to store positions and velocities:</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
let emptyObject = piCollide.emptyObject();

emptyObject.position.set(0, 0);
emptyObject.velocity.set(0, 0);
</pre>

		<h3>Keeping the balls in a given area</h3>

		<p>When creating a ball you can keep it in a given area by defining the area's top left corner (shown by the center
			x and y values) and the length and height of the area (shown by the scale x and y values). It can also be toggled
			by
			setting active to true when you want it to affect the ball and false when you want the ball to move more freely.
		</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
// Add a bounding box

circleObject.boundingBox = {
	active: true,
	center: {
		x: 0,
		y: 0
	},
	scale: {
		x: 100,
		y: 100
	}
}
</pre>

		<p>You can also use piCollide to keep the balls in the screen area by setting the boundingBox's center to the origin
			and setting its scale to the screen size like this:</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
// Add a bounding box

circleObject.boundingBox = {
	active: true,
	center: {
		x: 0,
		y: 0
	},
	scale: {
		x: piCollide.canvas.width,
		y: piCollide.canvas.height
	}
}
</pre>

		<h3>Adding bloom</h3>

		<p>You can also use a very basic post-processing system that is part of the ball object. Below is an example of how
			to add bloom to a ball after it has been created:</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
// Strength is the alpha channel of the bloom, 1 is completely opaque and 0 is completely transparent
// Diffuse is how far the bloom will reach, the greater the number the larger the area of bloom is

circleObject.effects: {
	bloom: {
		strength: 0.2,
		diffuse: 3
	}
}
</pre>

		<h2>Moving the Camera</h2>

		<p>You can access and change the position of the camera in for more open environments or to allow the user to
			explore a larger world:</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
piCollide.camera.position.x // default is 0
piCollide.camera.position.y // default is 0
			
piCollide.camera.position.set(0, 0);
</pre>

		<h2>Keyboard and Mouse Input</h2>

		<p>piCollide also offers the ability to listen for keyboard events, for example the code below will listen for when
			the user is pressing the "W" key (Caps lock doesn't affect the output):</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
if (piCollide.keyboard["W"]) {
	// User is pressing "W"
}
</pre>

		<p>You can also access the user's global and local mouse position at any time:</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
// Mouses position relative to the camera (world position)

piCollide.mouse.position.x
piCollide.mouse.position.y

// Mouses position relative to the canvas

piCollide.mouse.localPosition.x
piCollide.mouse.localPosition.y
</pre>

		<h2>Creating a Bridge</h2>

		<p>piCollide has an inbuilt function for you to easily create particle based bridges which can interact with other
			balls in the scene:</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
let bridges = [];

// Create a regular ball to act as a bridge piece

let bridgePiece = piCollide.circleGeometry({
	radius: 3,
	mass: 50,
	colour: piCollide.rgba(255, 255, 255, 1),
	bounce: 0.95
});

// Create a bridge out of the bridge piece

// Length is how many times the bridge piece will be repeated
// Spacing is the distance between each bridge piece 
// Start position is the position that the bridge will be created from
// Angle is the direction that the bridge will be created in (degrees)

bridges.push(piCollide.createBridge({
	piece: bridgePiece,
	length: 40,
	spacing: 7,
	startPosition: { x: 200, y: 200 },
	angle: 0
}));
</pre>

		<p>However, to get the bridges working you will need to use piCollide to ass distance joints between each particle
			by calling the distance joint update function in your game loop:</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
// Connect the particles in the bridge

// The number 1.5 is the power of the rope joints
// The higher the power the more tension there will be between the joints

for (let x = 0; x &lt; bridges.length; x++) {
	for (let y = 0; y &lt; bridges[x].length - 1; y++) {
		piCollide.distanceJoint(bridges[x][y], bridges[x][y + 1], 1.5, delta);
	}
}	
</pre>

		<p>Now when you open the website the bridges should be working!</p>

		<h2>Creating a Rope</h2>

		<p>Ropes are made in a very similiar way to bridges:</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
let ropes = [];

// Create a regular ball to act as a bridge piece

let ropePiece = piCollide.circleGeometry({
	radius: 3,
	mass: 50,
	colour: piCollide.rgba(255, 255, 255, 1),
	bounce: 0.95
});

// Create a rope out of the rope piece

// Length is how many particles long the rop will be
// Spacing is the distance between each rope piece 
// Start position is the position that the rope will hang from
// Angle is the direction that the rope will be created in (degrees)

ropes.push(piCollide.createBridge({
	piece: ropePiece,
	length: 40,
	spacing: 7,
	startPosition: { x: 200, y: 200 },
	angle: 0
}));
</pre>

		<p>If you want the rope to fall freely as opposed to hang from the top point you need to add the code below after
			you create the rope:</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
ropes[ropes.length - 1][0].isKinematic = false;
</pre>

		<p>However, just like the bridges you will need to add the code below to your game loop to allow ropes to work (You
			only need to add it once adn you can then add as many ropes with the code above as you want):</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
// Connect the particles in the ropes

// The number 1.8 is the power of the rope joints
// The higher the power the more tension there will be between the joints

for (let x = 0; x &lt; ropes.length; x++) {
	for (let y = 0; y &lt; ropes[x].length - 1; y++) {
		piCollide.distanceJoint(ropes[x][y], ropes[x][y + 1], 1.8, delta);
	}
}	
</pre>

		<h2>Simulating Gravity</h2>

		<p>You can also use piCollide to perform basic gravity simulations and have particles orbit and collide with one
			another, to do this you would first need to set the drag to 1 and gravity to 0:</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
piCollide.drag = 1;
piCollide.gravity = 0;
</pre>

		<p>Then in the game loop you would add:</p>

		<pre class="code-area">
// The Gravitational Constant determines how powerful the attraction between the balls is
// The larger the number, the more powerful the attraction is
			
let gravitationalConstant = 0.001;
	
for (let x = 0; x &lt; piCollide.objects.length; x++) {
	for (let y = 0; y &lt; piCollide.objects.length; y++) {
		piCollide.attract(piCollide.objects[x], piCollide.objects[y], gravitationalConstant, delta);
	}
}
</pre>

		<p>Now whenever you create a ball object and add it to the scene it will simulate gravity between all the other
			balls and by changing the balls velocity and their mass you can get them to orbit each other or even clump
			together into larger planets.</p>
